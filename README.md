# Terraform Datacenter POC

This repo is a modified companion repo to the [Automate Terraform with GitHub Actions tutorial](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/automation/github-actions).

This project is intended to demonstrate to some of my peers how datacenter services can be exposed using both easy to consume terraform modules and ServiceNow order guides.
